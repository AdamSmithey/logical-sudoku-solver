BUG FIXES:
    5/18/2023:
        Fixed bug related to the pointing_pairs_and_triples() method. This method was emptying candidate slots,
        resulting in an invalid candidate maps. The cause of this issue was me excluding all single-value squares,
        regardless of their value, from the row and column sets. This resulted in the production of false pointing
        pairs, thus incorrectly deleting values, and creating invalid candidate maps. As a result of previous
        removals, the candidate map would sometimes contain single-value slots that were not 0, so instead of checking
        the size of the set, I instead check the first value of the set, and if the first value is 0, I ignore the
        slot; otherwise, I include the slot in the row and column sets.

UPDATES:
    5/16/2023:
        Added x-wing strategy.

    5/18/2023:
        Begun adding simple coloring. This is much more involved than I thought.

    5/19/2023:
        I have decided to independently develop the single-linking chain code. This will allow me to use this code
        for any other methods that require a list of single-linking chains. Simple coloring will implement this as
        well

    5/20/2023:
        I have finished adding the single-linked chain code. This returns a vector of nodes. I still need to link
        them though by adding another field to my node struct.

    5/21/2023:
        No Progress.

    5/22/2023:
        Rule 4 of simple coloring mostly complete
